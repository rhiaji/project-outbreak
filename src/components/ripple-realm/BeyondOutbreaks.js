                The otters, pandas, bunnies, penguins, and hedgehogs have formed a strong foundation of unity, each
                contributing their unique strengths to this world. Yet, new chapters are always on the horizon. The
                Ledger's magic is unpredictable and wondrous – who knows what other animal tribes might one day feel its
                touch?

                This guide is written in the spirit of a casual lore journal – an invitation to immerse yourself in the
                Ripple Realm's history and day-to-day wonders. As the Ripple Realm continues to grow, every creature and
                every collector has a chance to contribute to its rich tapestry. United by the Ledger and inspired by
                each other, all tribes – present and future – will shape the destiny of this world together.
