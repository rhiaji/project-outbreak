                In the heart of the Ripple Realm lies <strong>Ledger City</strong>, a thriving capital born from
                collaboration in the aftermath of The Outbreak. Ledger City was constructed as a beacon of unity and a
                neutral meeting ground for all tribes. Once the dust of the Outbreak settled, the newly awakened
                creatures realized they needed a place to come together ‚Äì for trade, celebration, and decision-making.
                Thus, on a fertile plain at the convergence of rivers and roads, they built this magnificent city.

                Ledger City is a bustling metropolis unlike any other: Otters, pandas, bunnies, penguins, hedgehogs, and
                many more walk its streets shoulder to shoulder. It's common to see a penguin artisan haggling amicably
                with a bunny farmer, or an otter scholar exchanging knowledge with a hedgehog tinkerer. The city's
                design blends each tribe's culture. There are flowing canals and fountains (a nod to the otters' river
                homes), serene gardens of bamboo and cherry blossoms (tending to the pandas' tastes), cozy burrow-like
                nooks and lofty terraces (for bunnies and birds alike), and even chilled ice houses for the visiting
                penguins. All these elements coexist seamlessly.

                As the symbol of peace and collaboration across all XRPL tribes, Ledger City hosts the Grand Market
                where goods from every corner of the realm are exchanged. More importantly, it hosts the{" "}
                <strong>Council of Tribes</strong>, a gathering of representatives from each animal community who meet
                under the Ledger Dome to keep harmony and plan the realm's future. What truly sets Ledger City apart is
                its origin: it was built collectively by former rivals. After The Outbreak event united the tribes, the
                creatures pooled their skills to raise a city that would reflect everyone's heritage. Every brick, every
                canal, every street lantern in Ledger City has a story or a cultural detail behind it. The city stands
                as a living reminder that the Ripple Realm thrives when all creatures unite their strengths.
