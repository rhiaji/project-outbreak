                In quiet wooded groves and hidden nooks of the Ripple Realm, the Hedgehogs were among the last of the
                known tribes to experience their Outbreak. These tiny, spiky critters were often overlooked by larger
                animals before they awakened. The Outbreak for hedgehogs was subtle but profound: one autumn evening, as
                multicolored leaves fell, the hedgehogs across the realm experienced a collective spark of
                enlightenment. They developed intricate patterned spikes and bright eyes full of intelligence. Suddenly,
                the nocturnal hedgehogs became voracious gatherers of information and curious tinkers.

                Hedgehogs have always been quietly observant, snuffling through underbrush and watching the world from
                ground level. Post-Outbreak, this natural curiosity blossomed into a talent for knowledge-keeping and
                invention. Hedgehogs found they could remember and organize facts like no one else. They began writing
                things down, creating the first libraries in hollow tree trunks and burrows. By the time other tribes
                met them, some hedgehogs had compiled detailed chronicles of local plant properties, star positions, and
                even primitive maps of nearby terrain â€“ all without having left their woods. It's as if they sensed that
                one day this knowledge would be needed by all.

                When the call of Ledger City reached the hedgehog communities, they were cautious but determined to
                contribute. They traveled mostly by night, a caravan of little hedgehogs carrying scrolls, diagrams, and
                tools on their backs. Upon arriving, the hedgehogs became the scholars, librarians, and engineers of the
                city. They set up archives to hold all the lore and maps collected from each tribe, ensuring nothing
                would be forgotten. If an otter wanted to recall the exact tale of the first Outbreak, or a panda sought
                a rare herb's location, they would likely consult a helpful hedgehog archivist.

                The Hedgehog Outbreak added a deeply intellectual and inventive thread to the Ripple Realm's fabric.
                These creatures might be small and shy, but their impact is huge. Hedgehogs often work behind the
                scenes, designing clever solutions like water mills, star-compasses, or improved tools that benefit
                everyone. They're also the record-keepers â€“ thanks to hedgehogs, the history of events like The Outbreak
                and the founding of Ledger City are carefully documented in journals (the very lore journals that
                collectors and citizens cherish). In councils, a hedgehog might quietly pull out a scroll and remind
                everyone of important details or past lessons, helping guide wise decisions. With their arrival, the
                Ripple Realm gained memory and foresight; the hedgehogs ensure that as the world charges forward into
                new adventures, it never loses track of where it came from.
